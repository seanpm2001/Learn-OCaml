print_endline "I decided to make OCaml the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-OCaml) as OCaml is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the OCaml programming language. It only makes sense to OCaml the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
